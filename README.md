# Consumer Complaint Classification

Consumer complaint classification is the process of categorizing complaints received from consumers into specific categories or classes based on their nature, subject matter, or the industry they pertain to.
Consumer Complaint Classification is built entirely on Python to classify the nature of the complaint reported by the consumer. It is helpful for consumer care departments as they receive thousands of complaints daily, so classifying them helps identify complaints that need to be solved first to reduce the loss of the consumer.
